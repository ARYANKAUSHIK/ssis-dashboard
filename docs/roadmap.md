## Roadmap 

### Current
* HTML5, Bootstrap-Based, Web Interface, directly querying database
* REST API

### vNext
* Change Web Interface to use JQuery to invoke REST APIs to get data from DB. 
* Remove any direct query to the database from the website dashboard

## Current Release 

In the current release, no REST interface has been implemented yet.
Priority has been put to the web interface. From the web interface the page with detailed and historical information on a single package is still missing.
