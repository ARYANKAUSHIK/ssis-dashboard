##Installation Procedure

###Install Python 
Download Python 2.7.5 and install using default options from https://www.python.org/ website.
At the end of the installation process you'll have a `C:\Python27` folder

###Install PIP
Download and install the pip, one of the most used Python package managers. First of all the "get-pip.py" script has to be downloaded. It can be done using PowerShell
```
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -OutFile C:\Python27\get-pip.py
```
or `curl` or `wget` it fouy prefer (both are aliases for the above PowerShell command, if you don't really want to also install one of them)
Once downloaded, just run it:
```
cd c:\Python27
python get-pip.py
```
Done.
If you want more detailed installation instruction, please refer to pip's main documentation:
http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html#install-pip


###Install PyODBC
Download PyODBC 3.0.7 (pyodbc-3.0.7.win32-py2.7.exe) from 
	
https://code.google.com/p/pyodbc/downloads/list 

and install it using the default options.
	
###Get SSIS Dashboard Files
Get the SSIS Dashboard source files from GitHub

https://github.com/yorek/ssis-dashboard 

For example store them into 
```
c:\ssis-dashboard
```
folder.
	
###Configure SSIS Dashboard
All you have to do put the correct connection string in the 
```
config.txt 
```
file. That's it.

###Install Requirements
In order for SSIS Dashboard to run, the micro-framework Flask has to be installed. It's easy as doing this
```
cd c:\ssis-dashboard
c:\python27\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
```
provided that you downloaded the SSIS Dashboard source files into a directory named `ssis-dashboard` in the `C:` drive
	
###Run SSIS Dashboard
After pip has finished its work, it's time to run the web app.  Again it's as easy as doing this:
```
cd c:\ssis-dashboard
c:\Python27\python.exe app.py
```
now you can open your preferred browser and point to 
```
http://locahost:5555/
```
or the correct address name, and voil√†, SSIS Dashboard running for you.
