## Platforms & Tools 

SSIS Dashboard has been built using:

* Python 3.5: https://www.python.org/ 
* Flask 0.12.1: http://flask.pocoo.org/ 
* PyODBC 3.0.10: https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc
* SB Admin 2 Template: http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/

The IDE used is the phenomenal Visual Studio 2013 with the Python addin "Python Tools For Visual Studio"

https://pytools.codeplex.com/

## Installation Procedure

### Install Python 
Download Python 3.5 and install using default options from https://www.python.org/ website.
At the end of the installation process you'll have a `C:\Python35` folder.
Also the Anaconda distribution is supported.

### Get SSIS Dashboard Files
Get the SSIS Dashboard source files from GitHub

https://github.com/yorek/ssis-dashboard 

For example store them into 
```
c:\ssis-dashboard
```
folder.
	
### Configure SSIS Dashboard
All you have to do put the correct connection string in the 
```
config.py 
```
file. That's it.

### Install Requirements
In order for SSIS Dashboard to run, the micro-framework Flask and PyODBC have to be installed. It's easy as doing this
```
cd c:\ssis-dashboard
c:\<python-install-folder>\Scripts\pip.exe install -r requirements.txt
```
provided that you downloaded the SSIS Dashboard source files into a directory named `ssis-dashboard` in the `C:` drive.

Please note that the above installation steps install the packages in the global catalog. If you are already using Python it's better to create a virtual environment and have the package installed there.
	
### Run SSIS Dashboard
After pip has finished its work, it's time to run the web app.  Again it's as easy as doing this:
```
cd c:\ssis-dashboard
c:\<python-install-folder>\python.exe runserver.py
```
now you can open your preferred browser and point to 
```
http://locahost:5555/
```
and voil√†, SSIS Dashboard running for you.

If you want to be able to access the dashboard also from a different address than "localhost", you just have to set the `SERVER_HOST` environment variable, before running the app:

```
set SERVER_HOST=myserver.domain.name
cd c:\ssis-dashboard
c:\<python-install-folder>\python.exe runserver.py
```
